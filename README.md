I made this pan fried egg by figma. I drew two round elements indicates the egg white and egg yolk, to make the egg looks better, I added some bubbles around the egg white. These three parts make a cute pan fried egg. <br>
After optimized by SVGOMG, I put the graphic in html, the path "eggwhite-base" and "eggwhite-pump" are relate to the egg white, the path "eggyolk" relate to the eggyolk of the graphic.<br>
I use media query to achieve the second colour schemes. The egg will look different in mobile device or under 600px of the screen.
